          I imagine most people believe that fortune, good or bad, is rarely
          constant. That life's circumstances tend to sway like a pendulum, at
          times bestowing frustration or pain, and other times surprising
          pleasantries. I believe this too. But for some fortune can swing in
          the direction of hardship, and continue thus, unrelenting until the
          life of the sufferer is damaged permanently, or prematurely ended.
          This I know.
        </p>

          When I was still living in the United States, shortly before moving
          to Colombia, I read a book which examined in detail the horrors
          experienced by countless unfortunate souls in the so-called work,
          and death camps of Germany and Poland. One female survivor recounted
          how prior to being enslaved at Auschwitz, she would shriek at the
          sight of a mouse. But after several months in the camp, having grown
          accustomed to all its evils and degradations, would scarcely react
          when a large rat ran across her prone body. In the book there were many such
          recountings, others worse. Each providing
          ample evidence of how the fortunes of lives can turn bad, and never
          swing back. Yes, this particular woman survived the camps. But one
          can only imagine the horrific dreams, the galling memories that
          clung to her throughout her life. A psyche wrecked
          beyond the power of time's heal. And of course most in those camps
          died, their circumstances increasingly grim until death.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years of strangely persistent bad luck, only a few nights ago
          was the culmination of my personal fortune's downturn.
          Though I would never equate the breadth and depth of my misfortune
          to the sufferings by those of Nazis, it is clear to me
          that for whatever reason - or perhaps for no reason at all - my life
          was ultimately for failure and hardship. But there were corresponding horrors that night: vicious,growling
          rats,
          cockroach swarms. And hordes of humanity's least fortunate,
          living in a hell of filth, vermin, disease, stench.
          Wretched souls racked to life's worst. And there was death that night.
          Swift as a <i>commandant's</i> bullet but more...<i>haphazard</i>. A death not to be erased from my mind,
          until my mind itself
          is erased. And because of that awful, freakish death, I was on the
          run. How it was possible to be led thus, is a question repeatedly
          pondered. It defied rationality. A dark maze with
          each path sinking further into the insane. Of the journey, I can recount. Why I do not know.

        <p>
          In 2002 my ex wife and I started a restaurant business just south of
          the western Canadian border, in the sleepy town of Bellingham. Between us we had extensive restaurant
          experience, she
          as a server, book keeper and manager, and myself as a chef. I also
          had an interest in and appreciation for wine, so we included in our
          restaurant a small section of bottled wines for our restaurant’s
          customers, as well as for retail sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, the halcyon days. And after a few years working day and night,
          in which I put all of my culinary skill and youthful stamina to the
          test, our business was thriving. Hence I was able to hire two very
          good chefs to take over food execution, and begin to
          focus on what had become my true passion: the wine business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wanting to expand the wine business beyond the current space's
          capabilities, I endeavored to open another wine store with a larger,
          higher-end selection. And
          here is where I thought my life had achieved its ideal. With little
          to start with my ex and I had built a bustling and popular business.
          A business in which I was able to enjoy the fruits thereof--that is
          to say the food, wine and fellowship that naturally accompanies a
          good restaurant--now without getting beaten and dirty by
          the work. And having a good reputation from the local wine buyers,
          I was pretty sure it would only be a matter of time before
          cash and inventory would increase. Soon, I
          reasoned, my job would basically consist of weekend trips to
          Woodinville, Walla Walla, or the Willamette Valley; attending wine
          and food events (some quite posh); restocking and organizing my new
          oak shelves; and chatting it up with fellow wine enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly not everything was perfect. There were the usual
          construction drags, unseen expenses and bureaucracy frustrations to confront. And of late my
          ex and I seldom liked being together. In fact as time passed, she
          was coming home at increasingly suspicious early morning hours, and
          sometime not coming home at all. I imagined that she was spending
          more and more time at one or several of the area's casinos (a
          passion of hers), or that she had found another guy. Or
          possibly both, which ultimately proved to be the case. But I
          had passions of my own to pursue, and independent of her. If we were
          to divorce, that was well within the normal ebb and flow of life.
          A change of course, but litle else. We had no kids. Perhaps we would sell the restaurant,
          split the cash, and I would continue on with the new shop. At some
          point I would seek another relationship, but no rush. My
          life was good, and my future was promising.

        <p>
          It is strange to now reflect that at the time in my life when I most
          believed things were set to go well, the yet-to-be-told story could be so contrary. Maybe it shouldn’t seem
          strange, for
          life is nothing if not a series of surprises, great and small. When
          I was in grade school the most popular, best looking kid in class
          started complaining of headaches. In time he stopped coming to
          school. I had nearly forgotten of him when, a couple of years later,
          in a different class at another school, there was a new kid sitting
          at a table across the room. A short, heavy kid with a puffy white
          face, beady eyes and a crew cut. My stomach turned as the teacher
          approached me, grabbed my arm, and made me sit next to him.
          Suddenly, through the ravages of a near terminal illness, I
          recognized my former classmate. A boy who,
          in another time, and for him another universe, had been a good
          friend of mine. Somehow the teacher knew this, which is why she made
          me sit next to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial surprises at this point in my story were neither so sad
          nor dramatic. But rather a series of revelations and occurrences
          clearly indicating the trajectory of my life had changed, now
          inclining downward. One of the good chefs I had hired quit the
          restaurant, and was replaced by another whose work was poor. While
          at the new store, I began hearing from long time customers how the
          restaurant’s quality was deteriorating. Negative word of mouth was spreading, and since
          Bellingham is not a large town, the impact was swift.
          Business slowed. Different cooks were hired, but none were
          particularly good and the restaurant’s reputation continued to wane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then my ex began entreating me to return, telling me that things at
          the restaurant were truly collapsing. And though I was fully
          prepared to sever myself from my ex and our business, I suspected a meltdown at the restaurant could very
          possibly leech any
          success from my new venture. Also with each passing month of
          mediocre to bad sales, so declined the restaurant’s value. My ideal
          life scenario would have to wait. It took a few weeks to find a
          tenant and cost me some for breaking
          the lease, but eventually, taking all the stuff from new space
          and cramming it into the old, I was back at the bistro.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even2">
        <h4>Du Jour Bistro</h4>
        <p class="pn1">4</p>
        <p>
          It was summer, 2008. Since the restaurant had no outdoor seating,
          nor pleasant view to speak of, business typically slowed during that
          time of the year. During the present summer a water main also broke
          beneath the street in front of the restaurant’s front entrance, and
          for two months the street was under construction with no vehicle and
          limited pedestrian access. And during summer 2008 the nation wide
          housing bubble burst causing an economic malaise, greatly
          exacerbated by continuous fear porn from
          American news media. These factors in conjunction with the already
          sluggish business caused not just a slowdown during summer 2008, but
          a near stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          And during summer 2008, after she had been doing extremely well for
          two years following brain surgery, my mom’s cancer
          returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though business was all but non-existent during that summer,
          expenses lived on unabated. In the past my ex had always dealt with
          the restaurant’s bill paying and finances, since she had the
          book-keeping experience, and since I was always busy cooking and
          hustling wine. But now I had the time and felt it necessary to
          involve myself in the business’s monetary doings. In the summer of
          2008 I learned that the restaurant had no cash reserves, was several
          thousand dollars behind on rent, several thousand dollars behind on
          state sale's taxes (DOR), owed significant cash to food purveyors,
          and even owed back pay to some employees.
          Summer 2008 I also learned from my ex that the business was behind on
          payroll taxes as well. When I asked her how much, she calmly told me
          we owed the IRS about $75.000.00.
        </p>
        <p>
          She, my ex, was and would be fine. To her the restaurant was always
          something of a second job, her primary being a decently paid tax preparer for a local CPA. My whole life was
          wrapped
          up in and dependent on our small business. And I just learned that
          after years of hard labor, the business was on the verge of total
          collapse.

    </div>
    <div class="sec3">
      <div class="odd3">
        <p class="pn">5</p>
        <p>
          Immediately I sold off several of my most precious wines
          at discounted prices to get caught up with some of the more pressing
          debt. I took over management and for the remainder of the summer
          pared down staff, expenses, and inserted myself back into the
          kitchen. I reasoned that with autumn’s return, business would kick
          into gear, and I would again be at the helm to make sure quality was restored. In the meantime I looked into
          the history of the
          restaurant’s bank activity and learned that my ex was in fact
          spending a great deal of time, and money, at several casinos in the
          area. And that the money was coming straight from the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though scarcely being able to afford it, I hired an attorney to
          begin divorce proceedings. To confront and argue with my ex over her
          gambling and money squandering was useless. Over the years I had
          become aware that for her truth was not particularly relevant, and if she did not wish to explain her actions,
          she wouldn’t. And
          when I asked her some of the obvious questions, she offered
          no explanation. After talking
          with my divorce attorney and showing her the bank statements
          documenting my ex's restaurant-to-casino cash pipeline, she advised
          me to offer to take on the business’s debt in exchange for 100%
          ownership of the business. Knowing that I had about
          100k in hard-earned retail wine inventory (which I amassed over the
          years in lieu of a salary), as well as tangible and business value
          in the restaurant, it seemed good advice. And after speaking
          to my ex about it, she readily agreed. All of a sudden I was sole
          owner of the business and ready for the challenge to make it again
          work. And my ex was free and clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course I could not predict the persistence of the economic
          decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fall came but the usual business increase did not. I was having to
          shave off wine inventory in order to pay bills and keep the business
          limping along. Nearly every morning upon arriving at the restaurant
          I would look at the previous day’s sales reports. It was like being
          sucker punched.
        </p>
        <p>
          At winter’s onset Mom’s condition had become critical. There had
          been hope that she would be a candidate for a new treatment using
          irradiated scorpian venom to kill the cancer cells,
          but for whatever stupid, bureaucratic reason that fell through. I
          visited her each week, and each week she was noticeably worse. On
          December 11, my sister’s Christy’s birthday, she died. Mom, Carole
          Mae Adams, was a tough, responsible, beautiful person who suffered
          much and complained little. I hope her reward is great.

          2008 was an unusually harsh, snowy winter in the Northwest, and so
          our normal peak business season was not much different than our
          non-peak season, which is to say pathetic. One glimmer of
          light was a Christmas wine order I
          received via email for 24 bottles of Cristal. Cristal is a gold
          cellophane-wrapped champagne, ridiculously overpriced due, in part, to its favored status among millionaire
          rappers, and their more affluent lemmings. It was not unusual to
          receive phat holiday wine orders, but this one, (Cristal at that
          time retailed for over $300 per bottle) was particularly large.
          And if all went accordingly, the order stood to profit me close
          to $2000 of badly needed lucre. Procuring the full order was a bit surprising, since my normal yearly
          allocation was only 2 - 3 bottles for a wine of such prestige. Perhaps during a recession $300 bottles aren't
          in quite such demand. Anyway, I got the stuff and
          the credit card numbers (two were used) breezed through. Afterward
          the wine was picked up and sent to the buyer’s father without a
          hitch. The generous (and obviously rich) buyer’s name was Kellis
          Wood. And his father was going to have a very Merry Christmas.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the good fortune was not for long. The day of Mom’s memorial
          service was again cold and snowy. I needed to journey about 120
          miles south but I had a 4 wheel drive blazer with new tires, so I wasn’t worried about the snow. The service
          was to begin at 4 pm. My ex and I left around noon, giving us sufficient time. About half way to our
          destination,
          my ex needed to make use of a rest stop in Smokey Point, a small
          town just North of Everett. It was about 1 o‘clock. We were making
          good time. The blazer was firmly tracking the road and running
          perfectly. However, when my ex returned and I
          attempted to restart the engine, it wouldn’t. It turned over but would not fire. It was freezing and snowing.
          We were stuck at a rest stop because my car
          magically would not start. And I’m no mechanic. We decided to call a cab. It was going to cost a bundle, but I
          didn’t
          want to miss the service. We could stay at Mom’s house, which was
          near where the service was being held, until we figured out how to
          get back. So I wrote a message explaining the car was stalled, and
          would be moved soon. I placed the message face up on the dashboard,
          and we waited.
        </p>

        <p class="pn1">7</p>
        <p>
          Because of the frigid weather it took the cab driver almost an hour
          to arrive. It was a little before 2pm. We had two hours to travel
          the remaining 60 miles. The driver was a long-haired Native who fiercely braked and accelerated his yellow
          sedan on the precarious road. A few miles further south,
          somewhere between Everett and Seattle traffic slowed, stopped, and
          crawled. And continued to stop and crawl until we reached the north
          end of downtown Seattle, at which place two city buses that had crashed through a guard rail, still
          hung precariously above the Northbound freeway. Yet another
          oddity in a brief trip South. And though there
          was no apparent carnage the gawk factor was obviousy off the chart,
          hence the massive slowdown. Passing
          the air-suspended buses traffic resumed a normal pace. It was
          after 4. We would miss the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          We arrived at mom's house just as the post memorial guests were
          arriving for the remembrance dinner, cab fee $200. It began snowing heavily. In
          order to make arrangements to have the car moved to a repair garage,
          I called a tow company in Smokey Point. Yet another stupid expense. I
          was told by a man from the company that because of the storm all trucks
          were currently in use, and he would call when one became
          available.
          After waiting a couple hours and not receiving a call, I
          called him back. He told me he tried calling several times but
          couldn’t get through, and that now all repair shops in the area were
          closed. The car couldn't be moved. And the following day, Sunday, the car also could not be moved.... There
          was nothing wrong with my phone. There was
          evidently nothing wrong with his phone. But still he couldn’t get
          through. Weird.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used Mom’s Subaru to drive back the
          following morning. To see if by a miracle my car would start, I
          stopped at the Smokey Point rest stop. My blazer was
          gone. I called the local tow company to see if they had the car, and
          was told they did not, and that the county police probably had it
          towed elsewhere. I was given a number to call. Right. Though sitting for less
          than 24 hours at a deserted rest stop with a note
          explaining it would be moved soon, some jerkoff Snohomish County
          police officer thought it worth his and the taxpayer's time to have my car towed. In the middle of a snow
          storm. Perhaps my dead Blazer was a
          threat to the Smokey Point community at large. There was an after hours towing expense as well as a daily fee
          at the lot where the car was taken. And of
          course it being Sunday, the lot was closed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even4">
        <p class="pn">8</p>
        <p>
          The following day I drove back to the Smokey Point lot where
          my car had been towed. I paid the lot fee, and the fee to have it towed to a
          nearby garage. The car’s fuel pump was shot. $700. All
          expenses tallied it cost nearly $1700 to retrieve an aging
          Blazer that I bought at auction for $2000. And I missed Mom’s
          memorial service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to
          the bad weather Christmas week, normally the busiest of the year, was a bust. Crap business for 8 months. One
          good Christmas sale negated by car problems. I took a
          few days off between Christmas and New Year's, staying at the
          beautiful Willow’s Lodge in the heart of Woodinville Wine Country,
          one of my favorite places. Yet another expense I could scarcely afford, but I needed a break from the
          unrelenting
          shit-blizzard. And of course to
          get drunk. But the strange, downward-spiraling year of 2008 was soon to expire.
          2009 would surely be better.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it didn’t start any better. Sometime in early January as
          I was working lunch, A female in a flight jacket
          walked into the restaurant’s kitchen and started poking around. Foregoing the customary
          lab coat, she turned out to be from the Whatcom County health
          dept. A cockeyed she-twit clearly with a chip on her shoulder
          and an ax to grind. The configuration of my dishwashing area was not, she declared, up to code. I would need
          to submit a new floor equipment plan that was health code compliant, along
          with a $200 fee to have the plan
          approved. <i>All</i> refrigeration units required servicing, and proof of having been serviced would also be
          required. I was then informed that
          because a 750 pound dough proofer partially impeded access
          to a hand sink, I had to "muscle it out" to the back
          alley. Suggesting, I guess, it should be thrown out with the trash.
          And on and on. There was naught I could do but glare,
          fantasizing how that cockeye would look in a swollen mass of black
          and blue.
          <p>But I did not punch her, of course. What I did was service
            the refrigerators, submit
            the new floor plan with the shakedown money and comply with the other forgotten BS. (The proofer was moved
            away from the sink and, surprisingly, uncontested by cockeye.) I
            also stopped serving lunches, knowing that a twit from the health
            department would never come to inspect after 4. I laid off a
            day-worker as well, who subsequently went on unemployment. Nice job
            cockeye.

        <p class="pn">9</p>
        <p> Cockeye was a mere gnat compared to Steve Jackson. Jackson, aka Jackass, was an I.R.S goon, who began
          calling me on my cell
          phone in early January. I explained to Jackass that I was aware the business was behind on its taxes, but I
          had kept current for the last few months. I explained that I had made some $1000 payments at the local office
          and would continue to do so. I explained to him that I had taken over the business’s management, and was
          serious about getting things in order with the I.R.S. I also explained that in a fairly short period of time I
          would be able to pay more of the debt down with impending inheritance money. I explained to Jackass as well
          that I had no idea my ex (whom he knew and had dealt with) allowed the business to lag so far behind on
          payroll taxes, and that primarily because of the recession, business had slowed significantly thus making it
          harder to get caught up with things.
        </p>
        <p>Jackass told me that he cared not a whit about the business’s problems. He told me to stop making payments
          directly to the I.R.S office because, well, it wasn’t the correct way to make I.R.S. payments (though at the
          office the I.R.S always accepted the money.) Jackass told me that if the business was doing so poorly, I
          should shut it down. Not try to sell the business nor even liquidate inventory, but shut the place down. How
          this would help the I.R.S. get their money he did not say. Maybe they would garnish my unemployment checks. Or
          perhaps “muscle out” my heavy kitchen equipment to an I.R.S garage sale.</p>
        <p> I should probably confess here that I was a complete ignoramus dealing with this part of the business. I
          have a visceral antipathy for bureaucracy, especially the tax collection agencies, and their legions of
          overpaid parasites, and reams of mind-numbing, ever changing codes. I had virtually no experience shelling out
          the legalized graft of yearlies, quarterlies, monthlies, weeklies, dailies, State, Local, County, Federal,
          L&I, B&O, DOR, I.R.S., FICA, FUCA, FUCKYA, FUBAR. That was always my ex’s gig, and her being a book keeper she
          was infinitely better equipped for the job. So when Jackass told me of the sundry forms I needed to acquire
          and fill out in order to begin the approval process before beginning the process of actually beginning to
          proceed to make the progressive payments in order to prevent the impending procedural shut down order, I was
          admittedly confused. Jackass was clearly pleased with his superiority in the finer points of correctly coded
          and numbered forms and packets of forms; upper-and-lower-letter-case lines, boxes, rectangles and hexagons;
          primary sections, subsections, and sub-and-tertiary-subsections. And he genuinely seemed amused by my
          professed ignorance. Sometimes, I thought, he really had to struggle to keep a straight face while schooling
          me on his important business. Inside I was also laughing. Really.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even5">
        <p class="pn">10</p>
        <p> And this was funny too. One day I was sent by Jackass to retrieve and fill out some form or another from the
          local I.R.S. office. Except for two I.R.S. workers, the room was empty. I approached one of the cubical-seated
          workers and asked for the form. </p>
        <p> “Do you have a ticket?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“But there’s no one else here.”
        </p>
        <p> Oh, the disdain.</p>
        <p>“You <i>
            <really>really
          </i> need a ticket.”</p>
        <p>Keeping eye contact with him I walked back the requisite 3 or 4 steps to the dispenser, and plucked out a
          ticket. He pushed a little buzzer on his desk, and I was allowed to proceed. </p>
        <p> After giving me the form, he handed me another, smaller form, and asked if I would kindly fill it out,
          and drop it in a mailbox. On the small form were two questions: “Was your experience with the I.R.S
          pleasant? Were you treated courteously?"
        </p>
        <p>You can’t make it up.</p>
        <p> About this time, early to mid January, I was at the restaurant and received a phone call from a woman in
          Florida. She was angry and wanted to know why her ridiculously named business--"Spanky's Speakeasy"--had
          a credit card charge from my business. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about, and after
          squabbling with her for a minute, I hung up. Yet another idiotic, business-irrelevant call. And I
          wasn’t going to waste time with it. <i>Spanky's Speakeasy.</i>
        </p>
        <p>A couple of days later, while scanning my on-line bank activity, I saw to my extreme dismay a $3800 deduction
          from the business account. The deduction was described as a CHARGEBACK, something I'd not before seen. I
          called my merchant services rep, and asked him what the hell was going on. He
          told me he would look into it. He later called and said there was a contested charge by a business in Florida,
          and that the charge on the Florida account was apparently from my business. He also told me not to worry, that
          they were only holding the funds while the contested charge was under investigation. I told the rep I had no
          idea what was going on, explaining that a woman from the Florida business called me a few days before, and
          that I had told her I did not charge her business anything--nor had ever even heard of Spanky's Speakeasy. I
          also told the rep I really couldn’t afford to have the money held hostage until some unknown someone somewhere
          deigned to give it back to me. He advised me to call a woman in the fraud department named Sheri. He said she
          would clear things up.

        <h4>Sheri in fraud</h4>
        <p class="pn1">11</p>
        <p>Sheri in fraud was a monster. She was the proverbial pig you wrestle in shit, only to learn the pig likes it.
          Her voice was even distinctly porcine. She sounded like a fat, stout, stubby, stumpy, warty,
          flatulent, jowly-faced blob who resented all things and all people because she was in fact a fat, stout,
          stubby, stumpy, warty, flatulent, jowly-faced blob. She said her company--the merchant service company that I
          had employed and paid for several years--would not release my money until the matter was resolved.</p>
        <p>“But you
          can’t just take money from my account, clearly this is not legal,” I protested.</p>
        <p> “If,” she rejoined. “there is
          a contested charge we can, legally, take money from your account until the matter is resolved. <i>It’s in the
            contract.”</i> </p>
        <p>“The contract....What contract?”
        </p>
        <p>“The contract you signed for our services.”
        </p>
        <p>“Ma’am, I really don’t even remember if there was or wasn’t a contract, and don’t see how it’s rel--”
        </p>
        <p>“Sir, you had to have signed a contract in able to receive our services.”
        </p>
        <p>“Alright, so where in this contract does it give your company the right to take and hold my money?”</p>
        <p> “Oh, it’s in there, sir.”
        </p>
        <p>“Where in there?”</p>
        <p>“Sir, I do not know the exact location.”</p>
        <p>“Well give me an estimate. How many pages is the contract?”
        </p>
        <p>“Sir, it is your contract. It’s your responsibility to read--”
        </p>
        <p><b>“I need that money to run my business!”</b>
        </p>
        <p> “Sir, if you are going to yell this call is terminated.”
        </p>
        <p>“Fine, I’ll have an attorney call you.”
        </p>
        <p> “You do that, sir.”
        </p>
        <p> No one, not Cockeye, nor Jackass, nor anyone in my recent or distant past made my blood sizzle like this
          snot nosed pig-troll. I did hire an attorney who called the sow, and did a similar dance-with-the-pig-in-shit,
          and who sent her an “official” letter of objection to boot. For his efforts the results on my behalf
          were exactly zero. But I did receive a bill for $800, which I confronted him on due to its obvious
          exorbitance. He admitted that it was perhaps a bit much, and knocked it down to $500. One call, one letter.
          Only 500 bones. Big of him, no?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even6">
        <p class="pn">12</p>
        <p> A few days later it happened again: chargeback deduction from my business checking account for $3800. This
          nearly depleted my available funds, and would make it quite impossible to pay most of the upcoming
          bills. I called the pig Sheri and went around and around with her until I eventually shouted in rage, and was
          hung up on. At some point through the muck of anger and confusion, I finally realized the truth: Two
          chargebacks of $3800. The same amount for 24 bottles of Cristal Champagne, paid in two increments “Kellis
          Wood.” Stolen credit card numbers.
        </p>
        <p> I again called the merchant services rep, and told him what had happened--that I had a sizeable Christmas
          sale in which clearly stolen credit card numbers were used. I told him there was no way I could be held
          responsible, since I merely took the numbers as given along with the 3 digit verifications numbers, and the
          sale
          went through. He told me I needed to call Sheri in fraud.
        </p>
        <p> I called Sheri in fraud, and explained that I now knew stolen credit card numbers were used, and that I
          could in no way be held responsible.</p>
        <p>“If you used fraudulent numbers, then you are responsible,” she said.</p>
        <p>“But how so? If the credit card numbers and card verification numbers are valid and accepted by the credit
          card company, how can I be held responsible?”
        </p>
        <p>“Because you should have used further verification techniques.”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Further verification techniques, sir. You should have crosschecked the credit card numbers’ validity with
          the user’s address and telephone number.”
        </p>
        <p>“But ma’am, my credit card system is only set up to take the number, expiration date, and card verification
          number, all of which were validated.”</p>
        <p>“You should have crosschecked with an address--”
        </p>
        <p>“And an employee from your company set up the system!”</p>
        <p>“Sir, please do not raise your voice at me.”</p>
        <p>“Ma’am, I’m trying to tell you that even if I wanted to check an address and phone number, I could not. My
          system is not set up to do so.”</p>
        <p>“All our systems are set up to crosscheck--”</p>
        <p>“No, they’re not. Mine is not!”</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sec7">
      <div class="odd7">
        <p class="pn">13</p>
        <p>“Raise your voice again, sir, and I will terminate. And besides, anytime a fraudulent card number is used
          it is the responsibility of the party that uses the number to pay back the defrauded party. Not my
          company’s.”
        </p>
        <p>“You must be joking.”
        </p>
        <p>“No.” </p>
        <p>“But surely this is illegal.”
        </p>
        <p>“No, sir, it is perfectly legal.”</p>
        <p>“But ma’am, I merely operated the credit card system as it was set up to be operated.”</p>
        <p>“Sir, you used fraudulent credit card numbers.”</p>
        <p><b>“But how could I know they were fraudulent!?”</b></p>
        <p>“You had better calm down, sir. The point is you used them. And since you used them you are responsible.”
        </p>
        <p>“But this must be illegal.”</p>
        <p> “It is legal, sir. It‘s in the contract.”
        </p>
        <p> Eventually, it was I who hung up.</p>
        <p>And then you learn the pig likes it....
        </p>
        <p> I wasn't sure how, but I vowed to get my money back from this slop sucking thief. But the next couple
          of days I talked
          with the local police, my credit card company, my insurance company, various (un-hired) attorneys, and
          someone at the state attorney general's office, and...nada. I even sent an email to staff of the Clark Howard
          Show. It was never answered. (Shame on you Clark! ) Several times I called my merchant services rep,
          insisting it had to be in some way criminal for the company he worked for to hold my money. But he, a peon,
          did nothing except refer me to Sheri. And eventually he stopped answering my calls. As utterly illegal as it
          seemed, they apparently were not going to return my money. And I could find no recourse. In time I got a
          letter from the merchant services company citing some clause on some page of some contract somewhere,
          stating in arcane legalese the heretofore culpability of this or that party whereas or wheretofore the
          occurrence of this happenstance were to become a contested inevitability blah, blah, blah.... So in summation
          I paid retail price for 24 bottles of one of the world's most overpriced wines, plus
          tax. And then gave it all away.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even7">
        <h4>Cristal</h4>
        <p class="pn1">14</p>
        <p> Over the last several months my wine shelves displayed increasingly less bottles due to the long business
          lag. Now I was prevented from buying any replacement wine at all. And in order to make the wine shelves look
          at least respectable, I was forced to pull out bottles from my “cellar”-- a small temperature-controlled
          wine storage room. These were wines destined to improve with time and therefore would likely increase in
          value. Of course they were also intended for my own future enjoyment. Now, however it was necesary to cash
          them in prematurely. It made me sad. My “golden tomorrows” were being systematically erased.
        </p>
        <p>Probably because of the long spell of nasty weather, and because many people had been confined for so long,
          when the weather improved toward the end of January, we had a solid spike in business. It was exhilarating to
          be busy again--to see the place full of smiling faces chatting, sipping fine wine; and to send out plate after
          plate of great food. And what a relief to have some good money coming in. </p>
        <p> At week’s end after successive busy nights I was exhausted. Even so I popped open some nice bottles to
          celebrate, and had a wonderful Saturday night dinner with my staff.
        </p>
        <p>Afterwards, the roads were no longer ice-laden as I began the short drive home. Exiting the downtown parking
          garage I headed up the street, turning left at the light. Suddenly an oncoming car passed, swung
          around and followed me. First the high beams flashed. Then the whirling colors.
        </p>
        <p> In the police report stated that I made an erratic turn. That was a lie. I know I was
          driving fine. A few years prior I was driving home at night and noticed a police car
          following me. I was sober and making a conscious effort to make no driving mistakes. The lights flashed
          anyway. Since I was driving close to a seedy bar, I was made to take a sobriety test. While walking
          heel-to-toe I asked the cop shining the light in my eyes why I was pulled over. He told me I crossed the
          center line. It was a lie. But I wasn’t drunk, and soon on my way home.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="sec8">
      <div class="odd8">
        <p class="pn">15</p>
        <p>The Bellingham Police department acts very much like a for profit business, with DUI’s as one of its primary
          sources of revenue. While living there it didn’t really bother me that local cops were (undoubtedly still are)
          relentless in their pursuit of drunk drivers. But lying to strengthen their case, or to create an excuse to
          take action, bothered me a lot. </p>
        <p>This time, though not exactly drunk, I was under the influence of alcohol. And because of the long, busy
          week, I was fatigued and unable to completely overcome the wine’s effects when taking the co-ordination tests.
          I also failed the “field” breathalyzer, and was taken to the police station. After consulting by phone
          some near incoherent lawyer who advised I accept the station breathalyzer, I failed again. I spent the rest of
          the night on the concrete floor of an overcrowded cell.
        </p>
        <p>In sum the DUI cost me close to 10 grand. And with all the counseling sessions, AA meetings, court dates,
          probation meetings, and useless conversations with my attorney, it was a huge time expense as well. My
          driver’s license was suspended. I had to spend more time (24 hours) in jail. Though I still owned and operated
          a wine shop I was forbidden to possess or consume alcohol (???). Much of the system's process was
          a farce and waste of time. Boring, self indulgent AA stories; whacked out counselors with incredibly
          self-abusive pasts; stupid or “gotcha” questions from the probation officer (“and since when have you been
          clean and sober...?” “Actually sir, I got shitfaced just this morning.”); and urine tests (none failed). All
          those worthless mandates when it seemed to me that cash was what the state really only desired. Of the
          latter requirement, the occasional pee test, there were aspects of it that struck me as so absurd and
          undignified, I decided to pen the following:

        <p>Just when it seemed my world would financially and emotionally implode, I received a check for my share of
          Mom’s estate. It wasn’t huge money, but enough to get caught up on many bills and obligations, to bankroll my
          DUI expenses, and with some left over to run the business. After several months wheezing, I could breathe
          again. But as if on cue, Jackass hauled me into his office, threatening to close my business if I didn’t use
          the inheritance money to pay a fat portion of my IRS debt. A couple of weeks later, (and $3500 for yet another
          attorney), I had confirmed bankruptcy status and a case number. And Jackass was off my back.
        </p>
        <p> It was spring 2009. The economy was still in recession, business was still slow, and I was now saddled with
          5 years of monthly bankruptcy payments. At some point during this time I went through all the details of the
          bankruptcy agreement that my attorney had set up for me, and was dismayed by the total amount I was required
          to pay. Within the paperwork was a name and number for a Seattle I.R.S agent assigned to my bankruptcy case. I
          decided to call her for some clarification. Her name was Cindy, and she was remarkably friendly, candid and
          helpful. I asked her why my contract had me paying so much. She told me my attorney had set up the plan for me
          to pay all principal penalties, and interest. I asked if this was typical and she told me
          it was not. That normally in cases such as mine one’s attorney negotiated out the interest and penalties. And
          it was unusual that my attorney did not. My stomach started to churn, my blood boil. Interest
          and penalties were over a third of the debt, about $25k. And now that money was locked into a bankruptcy
          contract which I was obligated to pay. All because my $3500 attorney was too stupid or lazy
          to simply request the I.R.S remove the
          non-principal debt. I learned soon after that a percentage of each monthly payment goes to the bankruptcy
          trustee, so naturally he stood to gain from my loss. Whether this had any bearing on how my attorney set up my
          case, I don’t know. But if so, I would not be surprised.
        </p>
        <p> I called and spoke with a woman at the Seattle bankruptcy court, explaining what I had learned from Cindy at
          the I.R.S. She seemed quite shocked, that, well, anyone at the I.R.S. would be so forthright. That I was out
          an
          additional 25 grand was of little concern to her, and could not be altered. And of course, regarding Cindy's
          information, I wrote my attorney. He wrote back stating that it was not any of the I.R.S. lady’s business,
          and that were he to set up my plan in any other way would have been perjury. And “that is not the way I
          or anyone else in my profession roles,” he concluded. It took me a moment to decipher the moronic spelling and
          phraseology, but I got it. A moron and a liar. And Mr. David Vise JS came highly recommended.</p>

        <p> Perhaps I should have been more alert to the details of my own Bankruptcy. But at the time I was sorely
          occupied with so much other crap--mainly DUI--and still trying to run a business in which I was manager, wine
          guru
          and chef. But point taken: I should have been more alert to the details. One thing I learned while in
          Bellingham is that the town's lawyers are a lazy, self-serving, self gloating, and vastly overpaid bunch of
          chowderheads--generally speaking. And a $300-$500 hourly fee will not get one much from the majority of them.
          But,
          yes, I really should have gone over the work that I paid my attorney to do. Work
          which was, theoretically, in my best interest.
        </p>
        <p> So with yet another chain slung over my back, I continued to slowly pay down the debt from wine
          inventory and inheritance money.
        </p>
        <p> A year passed without significant drama, just a slow drain on my modest wealth, and diminishing
          patience with all things business. The economy seemed without hope, resisting improvement. And the restaurant,
          still under-achieving, was now for sale. </p>
        <p>During this time I wanted to find a girlfriend so I subscribed for a while to eharmony, and afterward
          match.com. Eharmony did not generate a single date, and merely proved that the levels of compatibility
          advertised by the company’s founder were complete bull. Match.com I thought a little better. Through match.com
          I did find one girl--user name Nighthawk, or Blackraven or some such thing--willing
          to meet. But after maybe 10 minutes with the lady--Darkswan or Sablefinch, or whatever--it was clear
          a match we were not. On both sites, probably because I did not lie about being short, I received very little
          interest. And from the interested few none to me were attractine or interesting. </p>
        <p>Then one night in late spring or early summer, 2010, I was inspired to try a latina dating site.
        </p>
        <p>The chosen site was latin-american-cupid.com. I used basically the same profile and photo as with the
          the other dating services, but the results were <i>very</i> different. Within a few hours of posting I checked
          my
          computer and there were already scores of responses. Women from all parts of South and Central America were
          sending messages with their pictures. Many were lovely, smiling women with beautiful names, honey or chocolate
          skin, dark hair and large dark eyes. And, though knowing only a little Spanish, I got busy writing
          immediately.</p>
        <p> And I stayed busy, writing and web-chatting with dozens of Latinas, and learning Spanish to boot. It was
          great fun. I was energized and inspired. But the whirlwind of communicating with multiple latin beauties was
          destined to change after Julieta.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even9">
        <h4>Julieta</h4>
        <p class="pn1">18</p>
        <p> The initial photos Julieta sent of herself were simply adorable: a well-proportioned Colombiana with dark
          brown, wavy hair, and a sweetly-smiling, heart-shaped face. Posing upon a rock amid a stream in her hometown
          of Bello, Antioquia, she wore a cute, snugly fit red and white blouse, and blue jeans cut off mid thigh. I
          was captivated. Rather quickly, in my limited Spanish with the help of Google translate, we were chatting
          regularly, sometimes for several hours. We soon agreed to
          stop corresponding with others on the site, and began yakking it up on Scype. And I began making plans to
          check out Colombia.</p>
        <p> As well as intensifying my efforts to sell the business. I
          was utterly sick of kicking the mule and wanted it gone. The venture had run its course. I had it
          listed on Craigslist and about every month or so I knocked the price down. With such a long stretch of weak
          sales and the economy persistently stagnant it was becoming clear that I wasn’t going to get a good
          price. Of the few who came to look, a couple from Vancouver B.C. seemed to be the most interested. When they
          first visited, I had the business priced at $55k, wines excluded. They looked
          the place over. Then told me there were a few other places they wanted to check
          out, and left. They came back a few months later when I was desperate to sell. The price was down to 35. They
          were interested and started taking measurements.
        </p>
        <p>The idea of selling so low after all I had done to build the business up, and all the money I spent trying to
          salvage it when down, was utterly galling. But I wanted, I <i>needed</i>, to move on. A former
          employee, now Food And Beverage Director at a nearby casino, indicated that a GM at the casino, (which
          strangely did well in spite of the recession) was interested in buying my high-end wine inventory. Though I
          couldn’t expect full retail price I imagined that if the GM was serious I could probably get $50-$60k. That
          combined with the money from the restaurant sale would surely prove a good
          starting point in an emerging third-world country. But first I needed to go there and check things out.
        </p>
        <p> By early winter 2010, my travel plans to Colombia were solidified. I had my passport and a flight booked
          from Seattle to Medellin (pronounced Me-de-YEEN, or locally Me-de-JEEN), Colombia's second largest city. I’d
          work through the holiday season, cook one more New Year’s Eve dinner, and close shop. It
          would be a little over 8 years since opening. </p>

        <h4>View from La Piedra</h4>
        <p class="pn1">19</p>
        <p> The Vancouver couple meanwhile met with the building’s owners, Marv and Biff. Everything seemed to go well
          among them. All appeared in order for when I was to return from my two weeks south. I told my Casino-manager
          friend that depending on my experience in Colombia, I might be very much
          interested in selling my wine. I was getting ready to move on.
        </p>
        <p> Colombia was just fine, and Julieta was perfect. As gorgeous in person as
          her photos. Sweet, soft-spoken, humorous, considerate, hard-working, modest, sincere, caring. We toured,
          chatted, walked, laughed, wined and dined, the usual things new
          romancers do. And rapidly and without effort became very close.
        </p>
        <p>After an initial week in El Poblado (of course) we spent the next 4 or 5 days in the picturesque pueblo of
          Guatap&eacute; (Gwa-ta PAY). Guatap&eacute; is a couple
          driving hours north of Medellin and boasts several azure sections of the vast and beautiful lake of the same
          name. At about 2000 meters it is warm when the sun is shining and cool when it is not. We took a bus and when
          arrived the weather was sunny and clear. </p>
        <p>Guatap&eacute; was a sensory feast of
          fresh, green-mountain air, warm golden sun, sparkling lakes, and brightly-colored homes and store fronts. I
          was convinced this was one the worlds most beautiful places. We stayed the first couple of nights at the Lake
          View Hostel, a rustic three-story a-frame owned by an American who was also involved local real estate. From
          him
          I learned that here one could buy a modest house on lovely property--creek side, riverside or even lakefront--
          for a price I would probably be able to afford. At least once things back home were settled. After years of
          outrageous fortune this seemed truly “a consummation devoutly to be wished.” But not death, in my case. Rather
          the dream of a better life. </p>
        <p> In order to fully appreciate the scope of the region's beauty there is a massive climbable
          boulder situated near the road between El Penol and Guatap&eacute;. Called La Piedra de Penol, the “rock of
          Penol”
          (which is curiously much closer to Guatap&eacute;) has over 600 steps built within a vertical fissure making
          it
          possible to walk to the boulder’s apex and enjoy the views below. And for climb's effort, the 360 degree views
          are a prize indeed, revealing the dense and lush greenery of the Andes, contrasted with
          miles and miles of multifaceted sapphire lakes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even10">
        <p class="pn">20</p>
        <p> Julieta and I spent part of a day climbing the rock; we spent time goofing off in the lake; spent time
          walking and bicycling in the mountains. We also looked at some of the properties for sale in the
          area. We both loved this beautiful lake-strewn, green mountain area. Warm sun, fresh air, cool
          nights, friendly locals. Who wouldn't? And if all went according to plan back in the states, it was all but
          certain that I
          would own a piece of it.
        </p>
        <p> But when I returned, all was not as hoped. While I was away the Vancouver couple met with the
          landlords Marv and Biff, insisting that though they wanted the space, they
          weren’t interested in the business. In other words, they did not want the existing equipment,
          and weren’t going to give me a penny for my restaurant. And Marv and Biff surprisingly agreed. I had 8
          years' paid rent--over 1/4 million dollars--in the space, and now the recipients of that money, Marv and Biff,
          were telling me to get out ASAP: Commercial stoves, ovens, mixers, soup warmers,
          refrigerators, freezers, sinks and dishwasher, stainless steel shelves, exhaust hoods with ducting, tables,
          chairs, plates, glassware, silverware, lights, lamps, various pictures and framed posters, display cabinets
          and wood shelving units, years of accumulated stuff in storage, and of course all of my wine inventory.
        </p>
        <p>I argued like hell with them about the utter stupidity of this decision (for example, it was going to cost
          more than the $35.000 restaurant price just to have a new hood system installed) but while I was away, the
          deal had been sealed. And though I brought to
          Marv and Biff this backstabbing new long-term tenant, I was being thrown
          out.
        </p>
        <p>It took about 2 months to sell off or give away all the accumulated stuff. And since there is not
          much money in used restaurant equipment, once again I lost big. The casino wine deal fell apart as well,
          or at least most of it. In the end the GM decided to buy only about $10.000 worth. Not
          chump change, but far less than I thought I’d get. So I worked another month or so selling my beautiful wine
          collection case by case, bottle by bottle, much at less than retail price. And when I had finished selling
          everything from my business I had about $45.000-- half of what I was expecting to bring to Colombia.
          Coincidentally the amount was about what I got from Mom’s estate. It was also almost exactly what I
          still owed from the bankruptcy. I had lost much but could take measures to prevent losing all. I could
          stay and pay, or take the money and run....
        </p>

    <div class="sec11">
      <div class="odd11">
        <p class="pn">21</p>
        <p> After selling my personal belongings, I arrived back in Colombia with $1000 dollars cash. I also had close
          to $50.000 in a U.S. bank account which had been set up by a Colombian financial firm for me to transfer to
          Colombia and convert into pesos. There was of course a fee involved, but since the Colombian
          government allows only $10.000 in U.S. currency to be brought in, the bank service was necessary. I was not
          about to try anything illegal in my new third-world home.
        </p>
        <p>Though Julieta had a house north of Medellin in the city of Bello, I preferred not to live there. The house
          sits high up one of the many mountains surrounding the city, and thus has wonderful views. But it’s a rather
          humble, concrete structure with music-blaring, pot-smoking neighbors, and cockroaches. I wasn’t really
          thrilled about the relatively large (300.000 or so population) town of Bello either, with it’s crowded,
          narrow, precipitous streets; reckless motorcycles, taxis and buses; binge partiers, park drunks and
          night thieves. It was an interesting, sometimes even exciting place to visit. But to live there, thanks but
          no.
        </p>
        <p> Instead we decided to look around in a residential section within Medellin called La Floresta, where we
          found a 2 bedroom duplex apartment. A lovely section of Medellin, La Floresta is not excessively hilly (as is
          much of the department of Antioquia) is quiet, clean and safe. It has a beautiful palm tree-laden park, often
          teeming with families, musicians or food vendors, and an excellent supermercado, (grocery store). The
          apartment we lived in was quite adequate: breezy, clean, quiet, and with plenty of sunlight. And being
          only a few blocks from two Metro (electric rail) stations, getting around Medellin and other urban
          sections of Antioquia was cheap and convenient.
        </p>
        <p>I have good memories of time spent in La Floresta. It was liberating to have a new life in a new world after
          the 8 year semi-bondage that restaurant ownership proved to be. And though not as much as I had hoped, I yet
          had some money to enjoy my new life. And in Julieta I had found what nearly all people struggle to find: a
          perfect partner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even11">
        <p class="pn1">22</p>
        <p> Bringing her sewing equipment from her place in Bello, Julieta set up shop in the extra bedroom in our
          apartment. Though far from being lucrative, the business
          made some money to help with expenses. She had three kids, two sons--20 and 23--and a 19 year old
          daughter. The oldest son David was a car salesman and lived on his own. Her daughter Sarah was a university
          film student, and her younger son Andres worked in a water purifying business owned by Julieta’s sister and
          her sister’s husband. The two younger kids lived in her Bello house. They all visited on a regular basis and
          were, for the most part, pleasant to have around. The kids’ father had died in a motorcycle accident many
          years passed, and Julieta had remained single ever since. </p>
        <p>But remaining single was soon to change for Julieta. And after a few months laboring to fulfill the
          Colombian matrimony requirements, we were married by a Notary. Soon after we took the short
          flight to Bogota, and a few hundred thousand pesos later (the exchange was then about 1 dollar to
          1800 pesos) I had my marriage visa. Then I acquired a Colombian I.D. card (Cedula) and was a married
          resident of Colombia. <i>Y Tu tio es Bob.</i>
        </p>
        <p>We began returning to the Guatape/El Penol region, poking around to see what we could afford to buy. A
          house on the lake was unlikely, but lakefront property was a distinct possibility. One morning while taking a
          bus to
          Guatape, a woman sitting nearby told us that she managed a nice lakeside Hostel en route,
          if by chance we were looking for a place to stay. We were and agreed to check it out. It was excellent. Much
          larger
          than a typical hostel, this was more of a lakeside resort boasting several large bedrooms + bath, each with
          gorgeous views. Outside was gently-sloping green grass; gardens with brilliant native flowers; mandarin,
          orange, lime, and banana trees; and a swimming pool with a nearby grill kiosk. The weather was warm and
          sunny.</p>
        <p>On the morning of our second day we went for walk. It was another perfect day. We were in the mountainous
          part of El Penol, the heart of the lake-scattered
          region that we had seen from the Penol rock. Walking the narrow dirt roads there was simply a
          wonderland of beauty: shimmering lakes, blooming flowers, lush
          vegetation, spicy aromas.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="sec12">
      <div class="odd12">
        <p class="pn">23</p>
        <p> Approaching a field worker, I asked him in my lousy spanish if he knew of any land for sale. Subsequently
          conversing with Julieta, the friendly fellow led us to a nearby blue and white
          house (with yet another spectacular view), and said to speak with Carlos.
        </p>
        <p>Carlos was home. He was a small, dark, talkative man, and did know of local properties
          for sale. One in particular, he said, was only 45 million pesos (around 25K U.S.) priced low because the
          property’s owner needed quick cash. That was certainly within my modest budget. We trekked a quarter mile or
          so along a dirt road and arrived at the lot.</p>
        <p>Adjacent to the road, the lot’s grassy top is an elongated semicircle, about 30 meters at the widest point,
          and 10 meters at the deepest. Plenty of space to build. One can see the Penol rock from the top, as well as
          many miles and various shimmering sections of Lake Guatape. The fairly steep land narrows and descends about
          90 meters, becoming less steep near the lake shore below. At the lot’s end, where the lake forms a
          concave bay, there is a grassy, gently sloping beach area, about 25 meters wide. There it is completely
          private, with a long and wide vista of nothing but lake, pristine land, and the Colombian sky. In the
          surrounding pine and eucalyptus trees that day were clusters of colorful, chirping birds. And swimming
          placidly in the clear water of the bay were schools of fish.</p>
        <p> With the ever animated Carlos, Julieta and I took the local transportation system--an old, beat up Nissan
          Patrol--to the town of El Penol, and met with the lot’s owner, Jos&egrave;. With my instructions, Julieta told
          Jos&egrave; we were interested in buying his property, and for a time she tried to get him to knock down the
          price.
          Jos&eacute; stayed firm insisting the lot was already undervalued, and that if we were to build
          or develop the lot we could easily sell it for much more. I had done some research of
          the area’s properties, and was pretty sure what Jos&eacute; was saying was true. So I bought it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even12">
        <h4>Lake Guatape</h4>
        <p class="pn1">24</p>
        <p> Back in Medellin I then acquired a large tent and inflatable boat, which we took to the lot. Camping at the
          lot was generall enjoyable: cooking freshly caught trout or tilapia over a simple brick stove;
          leisurely rowing our rubber boat amid the picturesque scenery; taking morning and afternoon dips in the cool
          lake water; watching the electrical storms and the dancing fireflies at night. But it became apparent that the
          perfect weather which we had been blessed with on our first few trips into the area, was not necessarily the
          norm. Torrential rainfall often made our excursions to the lot slick, mud-sloppy and
          and difficult to build a fire. Not expecting to always have perfect circumstances, we took the bad
          weather in stride. We did however wish to improve our future time spent at the lot, hence began looking into
          house-building options. And soon learned that the cheapest and most practical option--an option used by many
          locals--was to build a prefab.
        </p>
        <p> It would cost about half of my remaining money: A small concrete-slab and tile cabin and
          accompanying gazebo--or what the locals call a kiosko.</p>
        <p>With the prefab company’s owner, a Medellin engineer named Eraclio, we made the two hour drive to the lot. On
          lower right hillside, starting at about 10 meters from the lake and heading
          upwards, Eraclio lined off two rectangular spaces on the sloping ground indicating where the house and gazebo
          were to be. He then drove back to Medellin. Julieta and I stayed, soon joined by her younger son Andres who
          had ridden his motorcycle up to help with the work. Then Andres and I, using tools borrowed from Carlos,
          started hacking out dirt and grass for the lower gazebo space. It was a
          hard work, especially for my middle aged bones. But during the afternoon of the 3rd day the gazebo space was
          dug out with a level 2 by 4 meter floor to build on. Higher up the grass hill the larger, 4 by
          6 meter house space would require double the work, if not more. But that job’s undertaking was offered by a
          neighbor lad named Gillermo, who said he and a couple friends could have it finished in a few days, and for a
          strikingly cheap
          fee. Ever the haggler, Julieta groused a bit over the price but
          with my aching back I wasn’t going to let the opportunity pass. I happily agreed to their offer. They would
          start the following day.

        <p> Andres and I then rode to El Penol to get some food for dinner, but when we returned the clouds had
          coalesced, the rain had started, and Julieta had been unable to get a fire going. The rain’s intensity
          increased. We strung a tarp over the fire pit, but it was useless. The rain was descending furiously. The
          tent, which obviously wasn’t fashioned to provide shelter against a monsoon, was leaking inside and puddles
          were forming. It would be impossible to dry off and get warm. Prior experience had shown me that
          heavy Colombian rains are generally brief. The intensity of the downpour tends to exhaust the supply of
          water quickly, and the unburdened clouds move on. Not this time. The early evening sky was not cloudy or even
          cloud filled, but rather a flat mass of solid gray. I’d never seen it thus at the lot or in
          Medellin. Soaked, cold and hungry Julieta and I thought it best to slog the hilly, 2 mile walk to the main
          road, and grab a bus to Guatape. There we would meet up with Andres and find accommodations for the
          night.
        </p>
        <p> A week or so after we returned to the lot. As promised the worker lads had carved out the hillside space for
          the house, and had nicely leveled the ground. It had surely been a great deal of work, but the lads were
          well-suited to the labor, and were happy with the received cash. So in spite of the rain things were
          moving along. We returned to Medellin and made arrangements with Eraclio to commence with the construction of
          the house and gazebo. It was mid week. Eraclio said the work would start during the weekend, and with two
          laborers would probably take about a week to finish. Though the prefab company’s work would entail only
          building a shell: concrete walls with windows, a small bedroom and bathroom space, a kitchen
          space with breakfast bar, a wood deck, and a tile roof. To have this done, as well as a gazebo, in a mere
          week seemed nothing short of marvelous.</p>
        <p> After a few days we went to the lot to see if the short timeline could really be met. And indeed, the
          gazebo (a simple four post structure with clay tile roof) was done and it appeared
          the house only lacked a roof. Though cloudy and raining lightly we decided to pitch our tent inside the gazebo
          and
          remain at the lot until the house was finished.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even13">
        <p class="pn">26</p>
        <p> The following day the builders began on the roof, and by day’s end about half of it was completed. It had
          continued raining off and on, but with our tent and stove inside the gazebo, we had good shelter and
          little trouble cooking. And as incredible as it seemed, within 24 hours I would likely own a small lakeside
          house with gazebo, purchased on a shoestring budget, and with no debt. </p>
        <p> I woke up early the next morning to the sound of clacking tiles being placed on the house’s upper frame, and
          a light thrum of rain on the gazebo. The rain had been persistent throughout the preceding
          night, and it was evident that it was going to continue. But we were dry. It would have been nice to get up
          and on with the day, but the rain worsened, now pounding the roof. Not much to do until it stopped, or slowed
          considerably. Julieta was awake and listening to the downpour, smiling and
          clearly happy that we had shelter. To be exposed to the rain’s early-morning chastening inside our flimsy
          tent would have been a real downer. Pausing their work, the builders used the near
          finished house for shelter. I took a peek outside to check the conditions. Above was a flat, solid mass of
          steel gray. The dark gray-green lake chopped and churned beneath wind the scourging rain. It was strangely
          beautiful in its consummate bleakness. And how much more appealing would this gray, wet weather be once the
          house was finished, and could be enjoyed sitting inside on a cushy chair with a cup of hot chocolate, or glass
          of wine. One of the laborers then sloshed over to our tent and began conversing with Julieta. I was not
          able to glean much of what he said, but I imagined he was telling her that the work could not be continued
          until the rain abated. Then I heard him say something I could understand: <i>es muy grave. </i>"It’s very
          serious." Julieta then told me I needed to look at the house.
        </p>
        <p> Succumbing to the rain’s relentless pounding, part of the dug-out rear earthen wall had given way, smashing
          through a couple sections of the house’s back concrete slats. Yes it was serious. I was calculating how much
          more time and money would be needed to repair the house when a much larger
          section of the dirt wall broke off, slamming through the entire back section of the house. Dashing out the
          front door, the two workers and I just escaped before the two side walls collapsed, and the
          roof caved in. The three of us stood there silently and rather stupidly as Julieta emerged from the
          tent. <i>Muy grave.</i></p>
      </div>

    <div class="sec14">

        <h4>Cabanita</h4>
        <p class="pn1">27</p>
        <p> Eraclio agreed to rebuild the house at half cost, which I thought was fair enough. For 50% more I would
          still have a house for cheap. The alternative was, I suppose, to try and sue. Being in the business of
          building houses, perhaps he or his workers should have known the potential for the earth wall to collapse,
          given the nearly vertical way it was dug out. But even for rainy Colombia the downpour of late was
          particularly
          unrelenting. Thus it was more or less an “act of God” that really caused the problem. Besides, I knew nothing
          of Colombian law, and am an outsider. There would be no lawsuit.
        </p>
        <p> In an amusingly ironic form of punctuating the bad weather, I received an email from my uncle the exact day
          we returned from our destroyed house. My uncle titled the email, ARE YOU IN THE NEWS????, and in the text he
          said that while watching a news program, there was a story about how unusually
          heavy rains were causing big problems for Colombians living in areas Northwest of Bogota.... El Penol happens
          to be Northwest of Bogota. I guess I was in the news.
        </p>
        <p>I hired Gillermo and a couple other locals to remove the piled dirt, dig out the back earthen wall at an
          angle, and plant grass, precautions that should have initially been employed. And a couple
          weeks later the little house, "Cabanita", was again erected. I of course knew that in a way the heavy
          rains and house’s
          destruction was a blessing, for if not occurring when it did, it clearly could have happened with the house
          finished, and Julieta and I inside, a far greater tragedy. With the lesser of the tragedies having
          occurred, however, the amount of money I had remaining was now uncomfortably short. </p>
        <p> I really did not wish to run out of cash in a foreign country. Julieta’s clothing business took in some
          money, but probably barely enough to even cover the housing and utility expenses of our apartment in La
          Floresta. And I did not wish to subsist, day in and day out, on rice and the cheap corn staple, arepa. I
          reasoned that Medellin being a large, vibrant city, someone with as much culinary experience
          such as I had could probably find a job quickly enough. And if not, I imagined we could at least
          sell the lot, possibly for substantially more now that it had a house (albeit without plumbing or electricity)
          and gazebo. And then perhaps look for another cheap lot to buy, fix up or build on, and sell. It could be an
          interesting new business.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="even14">
        <p class="pn">28</p>
        <p> I was wrong about being able to find work. What I learned was that though Medellin, and especially the
          Poblado district, verily teems with restaurants of all types and quality levels, the labor pool of locals is
          abundant and cheap, thus to hire un Americano is rarely considered. It mattered not if I insisted I didn’t
          need to be highly paid. The unwavering belief among business owners was that whatever talent I possessed could
          be matched by some local at less cost. Why bother to hire a gringo?
        </p>
        <p> So I decided to make some improvements on the property and put
          it up for sale. There is a popular internet site in Colombia called “Mercado Libre,” similar to
          Craigslist which I used to post an ad with price, description and photos. Via
          telephone and email, responses started coming in fairly quickly. However most responses
          were from Colombian dudes clearly with a penchant to drink or dream, offering ridiculous trade
          proposals, or stupidly low offers of cash. Another block of responses were more reasonable, such
          as requests to make payments, or car + cash trades. To the latter I often responded expressing
          interest, but any follow up was rare. It was strange
          and frustrating. I was learning a hard lesson about doing business with a certain type of Colombian man: his
          words are mere words. I was receiving near daily inquiries and offers but none came from anyone with a genuine
          interest in buying property.</p>
        <p> Even with those serious enough to make the 2 hour drive to see the lot, the trip often evolved
          into absurdity. One morning, for example, I received a call from a man named Florentino who wanted to see the
          property that day. Julieta and I agreed to meet the man at his house, and afterward go
          with him in his car to the lot. (We did not have a car.) We arrived at his house as agreed, and hung
          around chatting with his family and extended family, until finally after an hour or so, it was decided to go.
          So we left. With Florentino (who looked like a small Robert De Niro), his family and extended
          family. It was a three car, two motorcycle caravan. Each motorcycle had two riders, and all three cars were
          packed. The journey began about 1 o’clock. Along the way Florentino, who was seated in the passenger seat in
          front of me, handed me a bottle of Mountain Dew. Though I dislike soda, I accepted the offer, and took an
          unwanted sip. Nope, not Mountain Dew. But rather Aguardiente, the hard, licorice-spiked swill
          preferred by many locals. I smiled at Florentino as the warm, sweet-burning liquid slithered down my
          unsuspecting throat. Thanking Florentino profusely, I handed him back the “Mountain Dew,” explaining it was
          perhaps too early to appreciate. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sec15">
      <div class="odd15">
        <p class="pn">29</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the town of El Penol it was collectively decided--as it was nearly always is by Colombians--to
          stop for
          food and drink. It was about 2:30. It took time to get everyone (18 in all) assembled and seated into the
          chosen humble restaurant. It took time to get the food ordered. It took
          a lot of time for the no doubt surprised and harried cook to simultaneously prepare food for 18 people.
          Towards the end of the meal, at about 5 o’clock, I told Julieta that we really needed to get going. But of
          course it took time to pay and get everyone reassembled into, and onto, the vehicles. At about 6 o’clock,
          as the Antioquian sun began its west-horizon descent, we reached the dirt road entrance leading to the
          property.
        </p>
        <p> About halfway to the lot the three cars, none having good clearance and each
          ridiculously burdened by load, were unable to pass a series of big potholes. I jogged the
          next mile or so behind the two motorcycles to the top of the lot. It was dark. The night was clear and above
          there were many lovely stars. But below the lot was an amorphous black void. Not a
          particularly good showing.</p>
        <p>Returning to the clan, there was little of note to report. And after a dithering,
          Chaplin-esque process of turning the three overloaded cars around, then stopping at a food stand for arepa and
          chorizos, we drove back to Medellin. Heading home I now accepted the proffered Aguardiente from Florentino,
          who had not altered his clockwork sipping since leaving his house. Sometime after midnight Julieta and I were
          back in our apartment. It was now December 26th. We never
          heard again from Florentino who, perhaps only through the licorice glow of Aguardiente, thought it would be
          nice to own a lake front lot.
        </p>
        <p>There were other weird, useless trips to the lot. Often with a carload of family members, and always for a
          meal or snack along the way. Upon arriving at the lot, sometimes the inquirers were unimpressed,
          other times approving. But the end was always the same: no sale. I began to believe that for many of
          the Colombian families, it was really more of an opportunity for a fun mountain sojourn, than an
          investigation to buy land. In most cases Julieta and I suspected that the “interested” inquirers had no money.
          But why should that get in the way of one’s curiosity and a pleasant day‘s jaunt? Then one
          day we got a phone call from a Colombian with the unlikely name of Anderson Smith who seemed very
          different.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even15">
        <p class="pn">30</p>
        <p> Anderson Smith was a thick, charcoal-hued fellow from Choco, the western Deep-Jungle portion of Colombia. He
          drove a fairly new silver Toyota sedan, and evidently owned a successful land excavation company. With only
          he, Julieta and I in the car (a first!) we drove (directly!) to the lot. He loved it. And after an hour or so
          enjoying the fresh air, scenery and sunshine, Anderson Smith made an offer. It was a few million
          pesos less than the asking price, and was to be made in two installments, half at the week’s end and the other
          half within two months. But the offer was reasonable, so I accepted. Stopping only briefly for a
          beverage and handshake, we then returned to Medellin. And en route we made arrangements to meet at his bank
          later that week on Friday.
          But....
        </p>
        <p>Friday came and Anderson was in Choco on business. He wouldn’t be able to meet until the following Tuesday or
          Wednesday, and would call then. On the phone he assured us of his complete commitment to buy the lot. After
          Wednesday passed with no word from Anderson, we called him the following day. We told him we were getting
          other inquiries for the property. He again insisted he was going to buy, but that he needed us to bring the
          property’s papers to his attorney, for her to look over. And as soon as she gave the nod, he would have the
          cash. </p>
        <p>The soonest we could arrange a meeting with his attorney was the following week. We made copies of the
          property’s documents, and dropped them off at the attorney’s office on Monday. After unsuccessfully trying to
          reach Anderson the next few days, we finally got a hold of him on Thursday. He said that his attorney told him
          the papers were all in order, but that he would be busy until the following Tuesday. And that yes, yes! he was
          going to buy the property. Though Julieta still believed the deal with Anderson was destined to close, I had
          doubts. I was once again telling other inquirers the lot was available, but since all the inquiries were
          from Colombianos, they were dubious at best. Tuesday came, and surprisingly Anderson called. We again made
          arrangements to meet, first at his bank for the cash on Thursday, then on to a notary for the
          sale/purchase agreement. I was starting to breath easier. It looked like the sale would be made before I had
          completely run out of money. Thursday at 9 am we were set to meet Anderson when the phone rang. Julieta
          answered the call. I could tell it was bad news. Yes of course, a woman from Anderson’s office
          said he was on a job, and could not meet. Appalling. Throughout the weekend we tried to reach
          Anderson, but he wasn’t answering his cell phone, at least not when we called. Finally on the following
          Tuesday Anderson Smith answered our call. He was no longer interested.

        <p>An American living in Colombia once wrote that regarding a certain Colombian man, words are mere words.
          After a few months dealing with this admittedly generalized man--in the relatively simple context of trying
          to sell him a small tract of lake property with an unfinished house--I was bitter, frustrated, and broke. For
          a while longer Julieta and I lived in pleasant La Floresta off her modest business sales, and
          SOS money one of my sisters was generously helping with. But soon our expenses, though
          hardly excessive, were exceeding our means. And we had to move. And that, of course, meant relocating to
          Julieta’s house in Bello. </p>
        <p> Along the North/South electric rail line, which parallels the latte-brown, fetid Medellin river, are
          numerous Metro stations spilling out into diverse Antioquian districts. Generally along the North/South line,
          those further south--areas such as Poblado, Aguacatala and Envigado--are cleaner and safer, with higher-
          income homes, better shops and malls, and a greater police presence. On the Northern side, especially from the
          Caribe stop (where the North Terminal bus station is) to points North, is where exists
          real squalor. Bello is (or was) the next to last stop on the north end of the metro line. Bello does not
          have the profound poverty--the long stretches of rotting wood-and-metal shacks, the mountains of stinking
          trash--as some of the previous stops. Places such as (the aforementioned) Caribe, and Tricentanario, and
          Acevedo. But Bello is certainly rougher, drunker, grittier, hillier, busier, noisier and edgier than much of
          Antioquia. </p>
        <p> About 2 miles from the metro station, up a steep mountain side covered with the burnt-orange brick homes
          common in Antioquia, is Julieta’s abode. It’s not really a bad place, but humble. A two
          story section of a brick and concrete building with a small living room, simple kitchen, back open-air patio,
          and steep, concrete
          stairs connecting the two levels. Upstairs are three small bedrooms, two in the house’s front, one in
          back. From the two front bedrooms the view is quite spectacular, overseeing the busy and populous Bello
          valley, and outlying Andes mountains.
        </p>
        <p>But the house wasn't to my liking. There was only one small bathroom shared by 4, and though the house was
          kept clean, there were roaches. I was also increasingly resenting the
          idleness, the inability to make money, the unsaleable lot, and our
          semi-impoverished circumstances. And having virtually no money, save that which my sister periodically sent,
          there was little I could do to change things. Until that damn lot sold, I was stuck.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even16">
        <h4>Bello House</h4>
        <p class="pn1">32</p>
        <p>Julieta worked day and night fashioning colorful bras and panties to sell in Bello and the nearby
          town of Copacabana. Her son Andres kept busy with his job at the water purifying plant, with friends, or on
          his motorcycle. Sarah, Julieta's daughter, spent days at the University of Medellin with her film studies, and
          nights at home frequently clicking photos of her large, tiger-striped cat "Tony."
          Sarah was rarely
          without her digital camera. But I had little else to do than brood over my again crappy circumstances. I
          worked to keep in shape taking long walks around the hilly area, doing push ups, sit ups, and regularly
          pumping a set of Andres’ leaden dumbbells. But I was bored and broke. It appeared that what I previously
          had thought was a change in my ill fortune, was really only a respite: that bad luck had hounded me to the
          Southern Hemisphere.
        </p>
        <p>One day when I was in a particularly dark mood I started an argument with Julieta over some trivial matter.
          Even with the lousy circumstances I didn’t often argue with Julieta, for I knew
          full well that none of my problems were due to her. And that she in fact was doing her absolute most to make
          things as pleasant for me as possible. She was a paradigm of optimism, patience, industry, and honesty. I
          loved and admired her deeply. But on that day I needed to vent. The argument began and escalated. For a while
          we even shouted at each other, something I can’t recall happening before. And to make matters worse, after
          things cooled down I learned that Sarah was home in her upstairs bedroom, she not feeling up to going to
          school that day. She no doubt heard it all. When I regained my sanity, I felt like an ass. I later apologized
          profusely to Julieta, who understandably stayed thoroughly pissed at me.
        </p>
        <p>The next day, though, Julieta’s anger was spent, and between us things returned to normal. Julieta worked
          most of that day in the downstairs part of the house where her tables and sewing machines were. And as evening
          approached, she decided to go to our bedroom upstairs to rest a bit before dinner. The two kids were away.
          From fresh tomatoes--which like so much of the fruit and
          vegetables in Bello were sold cheap on every other street corner--I started a sauce to be used with pasta and
          hamburger. It would be a typically humble dinner but good. I had become a bit of an expert in scrounging
          about the numerous food stands and markets in the area for the best deals. My mood was
          better that day, and I was glad Julieta had forgiven the previous unpleasantness. I was also anxious to have
          Sarah know that the nasty shouting she heard yesterday was nothing serious.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sec17">
      <div class="odd17">
        <p class="pn">33</p>
        <p> With the tomato sauce simmering, I started my evening workout: 30 push ups and 30 sit ups to be followed by
          40 simultaneous arm curls with the dumbbells. I had already taken a walk that day and was hungry, as I knew
          Julieta would be also. Dinner was getting close. I wished that it was possible to get some bread other than
          the sweet, airy stuff ubiquitous throughout Colombia. I heard some muted rustling from the bedroom upstairs,
          and in a moment Julieta appeared at the top of the stairs. She was watching me pumping the dumbbells and
          smiling her radiant smile. “Huele muy rico, amor,” she said, commenting on the sauce’s delicious,
          garlic and tomato aroma. And then she walked down the stairs. Or at least that’s what should have happened.
        </p>
        <p>What actually happened was that after a couple of steps she inadvertently stepped on the tail of
          Sarah’s sleeping cat. The cat screeched, turned about and viciously bit into
          Julieta’s bare ankle. Startled and in sudden pain Julieta jumped up and reactively kicked her foot away. Losing
          all balance she hurtled forward on the steep staircase. I heard a sickening crack as the side of
          her head slammed into the corner of one of the bare concrete steps. She tumbled onto the floor and briefly
          convulsed, A bulbous gash quickly forming on her right temple.
          Stunned I went to her. The beautiful honey color  vanished and her face was now a deathly gray-white. I
          dropped the dumbbell from my left hand, took her left wrist, but could feel no pulse. I felt for a pulse
          on the left side of her neck. There was none. The right quarter of her limp-hanging head was
          grotesquely swollen. Then Sarah walked in.
        </p>
        <p>We were in plain site of her. I was bent over Julieta with my left hand clasped on her neck. The right side
          of her ashen face clearly having been struck by a hard blow. And in my right hand was the other leaden
          dumbbell.
        </p>
        <p>Sarah’s eyes and mouth were stretched open in disbelief. And though it was not clear to me why, perhaps
          out of sheer habit, she reached in her pocket for her camera, and took a picture. Then started screaming. Of
          course I knew what she thought. I dropped the dumbbell, and raised my hands. Walking towards her I tried to
          tell her that Julieta fell, that it was an accident. But looking at me in complete horror and loathing, she
          ran out the front door. Her loud screams, now interspersed with sobbing, piercing the neighborhood.
        </p>

      <div class="even17">
        <p class="pn">34</p>
        <p> I had literally no time to think. The joy of my life
          had just freakishly died and it was quite possible, <i>quite probable,</i> I would be judged the cause.
          <i>Deemed
            my wife's murderer.</i> The night before was the argument. Sarah would surely condemn me. The photo would
          prove. It would be obvious. I would then be hastily tried in a hostile Colombian court. And then, How could I know?
          Executed? Thrown into a horrific Colombian prison...? Julieta you can't be dead! But
          looking at her I was sure. That growing, sickening welt. And her head so limp, lifeless. She was dead. My
          beautiful Paisa. My lovely soul mate. Mi otra mitad.
        </p>
        <p>I grabbed a coat, my backpack and fled. Soon, I was sure, Sarah would return with the Police, a
          lynchmob, or
          both. What the hell was I going to do? I was running down the precipitous streets. I needed to move. Get out
          of Bello. Get out of Colombia. But how? I would be pursued, hunted. And God help me if captured.
        </p>
        <p> Down, further down I ran. I crossed the busy central park. I was nearing the Bello Metro station, but knew
          I couldn't enter. There they would be waiting, right? It was almost dark. I needed to hide. Turning
          South I struggled over a chain-link fence and crossed a series of old railroad tracks. I reached the Medellin
          river. The
          filthy Medellin river. Continuing south along the east side I moved on. I needed to get to the
          bus terminal at the Caribe station. I had about 40 thousand pesos. I could at least get to Penol. There I
          would withdraw what I had from my U.S. bank account. Fortunately I had my backpack
          and wallet. There was a bus stop to
          El Penol a couple blocks from the terminal. If I
          could just get to El Penol, then I could then go to the lot. My beautiful lakeside
          lot. Then think things through. But first I needed to get to the Caribe terminal. Acevedo,
          Tricentenario then Caribe. Oh shit. I had to pass through that festering third world slum. Oh shit. How many
          times I'd imagined the horrors. And soon I'd be in that evil place. <i>At  night.</i> There was no other option.

        <h4>Medellin River</h4>
        <p class="pn1">35</p>
        <p>The moon was out that night, about 3/4 full. And as the occasional cloud passed beneath the Medellin
          river displayed many different facets of its brown, stinking ugliness. I was hustling through Madera, the
          sparsely populated stretch of green hills and new condos between Bello and Acevedo. How dramatically the
          landscape would soon change. I could make out some of the frightful little hovels ahead. I could smell the
          vast tracts of garbage. Closer and closer my nightmare approached. Then I was inside.
        </p>
        <p> It was among the worst areas in Medellin, a city of over 3 million that has many bad areas. Most of
          the city's slums are strung out along the mountains above. Miles and miles of hastily thrown together wood,
          metal, and shoddy brick structures, some precariously pitched on mere sticks against the steep hillsides. Ironically a
          majority of these dirt poor abodes have million dollar views of the vast Andes mountains, and the
          sprawling Medellin metropolis. Many of these slum-residents are families that were, in years past,
          forced off their rural farm land when the infamous Colombian violencia was in full fury. Apparently Pablo
          Escobar, one of the 20th century’s richest coke dealers, paid to have these shanties built in order to garner
          support from the masses that would occupy them. And to many of Colombia’s poor he was, and yet is, a
          hero. But intense poverty has always been the hallmark of these Medellin hillside areas--poverty matched by
          violence. Know a tree by its fruits. Gang wars, torture, brutal assassinations  are common. By
          and large the Police stay away. </p>
        <p>Taking a narrow road that hugged fairly close to the river and Metro track, I made my way through the
          slum. The squalor was worse here than were I to take a route higher up the hillside, but I sensed it would be
          safer--that the worst of the criminal elements would likely steer clear of the lower filth. I passed row
          after row of foul brick structures and dumpy wooden shacks. Some 
          had impossibly large families crowded into rag-strewn yards, or mashed together on
          rotting furniture, staring at old television sets. In front of many of these appalling homes older women were
          cooking sancocho, a type of Colombian stew, in old metal pots over small fire pits. The gray, billowing smoke had a foul, toxic smell. There were sickly, rash-infested dogs that roamed and sniffed
          about on nearly every street. I was sure that here rabies was common.</p>
        <p>After a mile or so the road sloped downwards, closer to the river. Impossible as it seemed, the living
          conditions became worse. Now was a veritable mountain of putrid garbage mingled with human life's least fortunate. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even18">
        <p class="pn">36</p>
        <p> The stench of rot, sewage and river-dumped chemicals was almost tangible. I struggled to keep from vomiting.
          I was harassed by insects. Occasionally a garbage dweller would take note of
          me, and from his eye would gleam the hostile recognition of an outsider, an alien.</p>
        <p>From my peripheral vision I caught frequent shadowy glimpses of what I first thought were more sickly
          dogs, but soon realized were rats. And as I moved along the rats crept brazenly closer. Unlike the dogs, these animals were fat and healthy, with devil-red eyes. I picked up the pace when something caught my eye. An animal corpse, cat perhaps, lay ragged in the gutter, feasted upon by a swarm of maggots. </p>
        <p>Garbage, stench, vermin. The horrific poverty continued as I trekked south along the
          river. The road arched up and away from the Tricentenario Metro station, then wound back towards the viscous
          brown river. The tiny hovels here had no electricity, no lights. But from the moonlight
          I could often make out slum-befouled human activity. Filthy children playing in piles of debris; small, deformed men and women, with rotted teeth, languishing atop
          improvised seats of moldy cardboard or piled stones. And yet again, bent, elderly women boiling something--I
          tried to refrain from thinking what--in old tin pots over reeking, trash-made fires. </p>
        <p>When I owned my restaurant/wine business I regularly attended food and wine events hosted by the
          numerous wine distributors in the Seattle area. Among the swankiest of these was an annual event that took
          place 70+ stories high, at the top of the Columbia Tower in downtown Seattle. It was sheer hedonistic excess.
          Banquet tables heaping with trays of brightly colored melons, pineapples, strawberries, grapes; rich blue and
          green veined, triple-cream cheeses; great slabs of beef, ham, turkey and salmon; sausages, pates and aspics;
          huge baskets of fresh-baked breads; pastries, cheesecakes, tortas, chocolates. And of course wine. Table after
          table of some of the planets most delicious nectars: Napa Valley Cabernet; Washington State Syrah; Barolo and
          Barbaresco; Burgundian Chardonnay; German Riesling; Oregon Pinot Noir; Bordeaux; Chateauneuf du Pape; Vintage
          Port. Literally hundreds of different wines to sample from lovely crystalline stemware beneath sparkling
          chandeliers. And in the company of scores of formally attired men and women fortunate enough to have been born
          with such incredible opportunity for pleasure. I couldn’t help thinking of some these events, as I snaked through this reeking third world sewer. Nor how utterly different could the lives of human
          beings be simply due to chance.

        <h4>Tricentenario hillside</h4>
        <p class="pn1">37</p>
        <p> Continuing on through Tricentenario the road again twisted steeply upwards to the left, and into a barrio
          less squalid. Here was one of Colombia’s rough hillside neighborhoods. And I well knew this was far more dangerous
          than what I had just gone through. Dim streets with music blaring from laundry-heaped, dirty brick or wood houses;
          youths openly smoking pot, or doing coke; reckless motorcycles roaring by; grim, booze-quaffing men
          beneath scarcely lit, shoddy cafe awnings. I kept my head down and hurried along. As in the garbage-filled
          slum of Acevedo, there was no police presence here. Nor, like the Acevedo slum, would I need to worry about
          the police coming here to find me. Only a suicidal americano would enter this world, where the lives of
          Colombians have only scant value; and of Grinos, no value at all. One could only image how many human corpses
          had become the putrid feast of vermin along the trash-strewn riverbed below.
        </p>
        <p> Further along I approached a group of tattooed thugs gathered in front of a small, iron-bar enclosed liquor
          store. They were standing around a small table passing a liter bottle of Aguardiente. I smelled pot. One of them caught my lowered eye, and I sensed he recognized me for what I was: a terrified
          foreigner. A man woefully out of his element. He said something to the others and they all laughed. Then said
          something, I think to me, that I did not understand. I kept walking. </p>
        <p> <i>“Oiga tonto, tu no debes ser aqui,”</i> he continued, and they again laughed. This I understood: “Hey
          dumb ass, you shouldn’t be here.” Holding my breath, I walked on.</p>
        <p> <i>“Alguien se va a cortar tu garganta y robar tu dinero,”</i> he mocked. “Someone is going to cut your
          throat and take your money.”</p>
        <p> <i>“No tengo, no tengo,” </i>I said, the my strained voice utterly betraying fear. </p>
        <p>The gang erupted in laughter. <i>“Gringo pendejo, corre, corre.” </i></p>
        <p> My legs were trembling and uncertain, but I yet continued walking. Perhaps because of my humble
          attire, which I made a point to wear in Colombia, they believed I really had no money. Or who
          knows, maybe the pot had mellowed them--or maybe they just weren’t the thieving, murdering type. But they
          didn’t follow me. At length my legs steadied and I hustled along, praying to be unnoticed. Eventually
          the road sloped downwards, and I was again passing through the dark slums near the river. Finally the lights
          of the Caribe station bus terminal came into sight.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="even19">
        <p class="pn">38</p>
        <p> I wasn’t certain how far, nor for how long I had been walking. Nor was I certain of the time. But at last I
          came upon the bridge leading to the Caribe bus terminal. I crossed the bridge and took the stairs down to the
          street. Avoiding any lights, I got to a point close
          to where the bus for El Penol would be stopping early next morning. I found a tree-darkened area and sat
          down. And in spite of the recent nightmare fresh in my mind, I dozed off.
        </p>
        <p> I caught the 7 am bus, and a couple hours later I arrived in El Penol. I was weary and confused. The
          surrealistic past events and abruptness in which my life and future had horribly twisted, rendered the world a
          strange, menacing, evil place. I was grief-stricken, alone and fighting hard not to cry.</p>
        <p>While in El Penol I thought about using an internet cafe to try and reach my sister. If made aware of my
          circumstances, she would certainly transfer enough money into my account for me to fly back home. But I knew I
          couldn't leave the country. By the time all my travel affairs were in order, Medellin airport security surely
          would be on the watch for me, if they were not already. Perhaps they even now had the damning photo. I would
          be apprehended and jailed. Likely abused, and tortured; maybe then executed. On my life the iron door had
          shut; the illness pronounced terminal. I literally had no hope. And I realized that all my previous problems,
          no matter how bad they seemed, were really trifles. For in the past I always had at least some option to make
          a change, to alter my life’s course, and perhaps realize a happier tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p> At the lot at least I would have a little time to reflect unmolested; and the opportunity to  make the grim choice. I went to an ATM and withdrew the extent of my cash: 80 thousand pesos, about 40
          buck’s worth. I shopped at a couple of places nearby, filling my backpack with prepared food and a 5 liter bag
          of water. Then I bought a pen and notebook. At 10 o’clock I took the transport to the stop near my property,
          and walked down to my house and kiosko by the lake.
        </p>
        <p> Of course I knew that Sarah would lead the Bello Police to the lot, once they had unsuccessfully searched
          the city. Sarah knew I was broke and thus limited in options. She would conclude, as had I, that the lot would
          be the best place to go. The amount of time I would have before the Police's arrival I also knew would be
          short, a couple of days, or perhaps only a few hours. So I began at once on my story--the story I am now
          writing.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="sec20">
      <div class="odd20">
        <p class="pn">39</p>
        <p> I thought at first about only writing of Julieta's tragic, accidental death as a potential advocate for my
          defense, if I choose to be apprehended. For of course that is one of my two choices. But as fate would have it
          there has been sufficient time to write from the start of my life's decline. 
          pondering the details It has been interesting to recall. How oddly unfortunate it has been.</p>
        <p>  I have often been tempted to succumb to perfect bitterness, and to
          “curse God” as Job was tempted. And though sick with confusion and resentment, like Job I have refrained. All
          earthen life is short, all earthen pleasures fleeting. This reason knows, in spite of emotion’s objections.
          Barring instant death each of us must acknowledge the inevitability of suffering and termination. And present
          among life’s possibilities for everyone is the path of ever worsening circumstances. </p>
        <p>Perhaps I shall at some point know the reason for, and hence understand, my life’s descent: The failure of my
          business; the loss of my modest wealth; the abridgment of my liberty; the sudden death of my wife. And at last
          the hard choice. </p>
        <p>
          Though I am yet in good health amid a world of sunlight, color, and motion here at this beautiful place--my
          lot, if only for a moment longer--this too must soon end. And indeed, now they come. During moments of clarity
          I have seen that this life is but a sadness. Why is a mystery. But we all, at length, must accept the lot we
          have been given.
